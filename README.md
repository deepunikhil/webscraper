# üëö Webscraper for Price Comparison

Project was motivated by a student project at [Forkaia incubator](https://www.forkaia.com/) building a shopping assistant application for professional women. The algorithm automatizes web scraping process from three online stores: Nordstrom, Macy's and Neiman Marcus, and generates a csv file containing the list of all overlapping items and their prices.

## üï∏Ô∏è Webscraping

[Beatiful Soup HTML parser](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [Selenium webdriver](https://selenium.dev/) were used alongside Python for webscraping process. Within the scripts folder are the actual Python scripts. The scripts share three methods: `fetch_url`, `fetch_page`, and `fetch_all`.

1. The `fetch_url` method returns the http address of an item category's first shopping page. The only parameter is the item category represented by pre-defined strings. There are a total of five categories currently available:
    * women's shoes
    * women's clothing
    * men's shoes
    * men's clothing
    * handbags
2. The `fetch_page` takes in the http address of a single shopping page and a dataframe. The method fills the dataframe with information of listed items such as item name, price and link.
3. The `fetch_all` methods also takes in the https address of a shopping page and a dataframe. The method automatically moves on to next page and calls `fetch_page` method until it reaches the very end.

Calling `fetch_page` for each file generates a corresponding .csv file in the data folder which contains all scraped data. The actual logic behind the three methods are, as one would expect, similar. The only reason they have been separated out into different scripts are the differing HTML file structures and class names. Adding onto the list of online stores would only be a matter of taking the time to deconstruct the HTML structure of the new online store and incorporating the information to the existing methods.

## üìã Table Generator

`table_generator.py` has a `compare_price` method that takes in one of the five item categories listed above and generates `output.csv` in the root directory containing a list of all overlapping items with their prices and store links (note that the item names will have been processed for ease of comparison). The current version lists all items in the women's shoes category as of January 2nd, 2020.
